hpsa: reserve some commands for use by driver

From: Stephen M. Cameron <scameron@beardog.cce.hp.com>

We need to reserve some commands for device rescans,
aborts, and the pass through ioctls, etc. so we cannot
give them all to the scsi mid layer.

This is in preparation for removing cmd_special_alloc and
cmd_special_free so that we can stop queuing commands internally
in the driver so that we can remove the locks thta protect the
queue that we will no longer have.
