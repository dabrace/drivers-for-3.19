hpsa: mark masked devices as masked in output

From: Stephen M. Cameron <scameron@beardog.cce.hp.com>

Otherwise it can seems as though there is a discrepancy between
the driver's output and the output of lsscsi when the driver
claims to have "added" a device but then does not actually call
scsi_add_device() for it because it is masked.
