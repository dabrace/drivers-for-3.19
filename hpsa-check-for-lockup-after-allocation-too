hpsa: check for ctlr lockup after command allocation in main io path

From: Stephen M. Cameron <scameron@beardog.cce.hp.com>

Command allocation is the thing that takes the longest in the main i/o
path, so check for controller lockup immediately after this to prevent
submitting commands to locked up controller as much as possible.
