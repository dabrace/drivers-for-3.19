hpsa: do not touch phys_disk[] for ioaccel enabled logical drives during rescan

From: Stephen M. Cameron <scameron@beardog.cce.hp.com>

The code to update h->dev[]->phys_disk[] was temporarily NULLing out
h->dev[]->phys_disk[] even if io's using it might be in flight within
queuecommand, causing potential NULL pointer dereference in hpsa_raid_map().
