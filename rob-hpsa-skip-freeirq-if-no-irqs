hpsa: skip free_irq calls if irqs are not allocated

From: Robert Elliott <elliott@hp.com>

If try_soft_reset fails to re-allocate irqs, the error exit
starts with free_irq calls, which generate kernel WARN
messages since they were already freed a few lines earlier.

Jump to the next exit label to skip the free_irq calls.
